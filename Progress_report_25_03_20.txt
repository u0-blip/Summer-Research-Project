Things to do this week:
1. Look into Gmsh
    a. If Gmsh is compatible with Abaqus
2. Investigate microwave lights
3. Create simple full chain simulation
4. Create complex full chain simulation
5. Incorporate co-simulation with MEEP and Abaqus

Can also model the interaction between the cutting blade and the heated rock. Which requires the knowledge of metal component modeling.
